# A Simple Utility to Launch Steam Games from the Terminal on Linux

## Why?

Although Steam provides the ability to launch games via terminal with a command like:
```bash
$ steam steam://rungameid/{appid}
```
This requires you to input the gameâ€™s appid each time, which is not very convenient. `steam-launch` simplifies this process by letting you create and manage game aliases and effortlessly launch games by alias.

## Features

- Launch Steam games from terminal by custom aliases.
- Manage and remove aliases.
- Automatically find appids.
- Customize settings for non-standard Steam installations.
- Customize Steam launch arguments.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation (Optional)

You can add `steam-launch.sh` to PATH for easier access. Of course you can make a custom alias for it. All examples below assume you have it added to PATH as `steam-launch`.

### 2. Initialize the Configuration Directory (Optional)

Run the following command to initialize the config directory:
```bash
$ steam-launch --init
```
This will create a config directory at `~/.config/steam-launch/` and initialize necessary files there.
If you're using Flatpak version of Steam use `--flatpak` option:
```bash
$ steam-launch --init --flatpak
```
If you're using Snap version of Steam use `--snap` option:
```bash
$ steam-launch --init --snap
```
You can skip this step unless you're going to use `--flatpak` option or you want to manually edit the config before using the tool. If config directory doesn't exist it will be initialize automatically when you create an alias or change settings.

### 3. Adding Aliases

There are several ways to add game aliases:
#### a. Manually
You can manually enter appid:
```bash
$ steam-launch --alias -m {alias} {appid}
```
Example:
```bash
$ steam-launch --alias -m rdr2 1174180
```
#### b. Searching Local Files
You can search for the game by its name in Steam local files:
```bash
$ steam-launch --alias -l {game_name} {alias}
```
Example:
```bash
$ steam-launch --alias -l "Red Dead Redemption 2" rdr2
```
If you want the alias to be the exact game name, omit the alias argument:
```bash
$ steam-launch --alias -l {game_name}
```
Example:
```bash
$ steam-launch --alias -l Portal
```
**Note 1:** This works only for installed games or games that have residual files in the `steamapps` directory.
**Note 2:** Game name must be exact match (case sensitive).
**Note 3:** For some non-standard Steam installations you may need to update `steam-launch` settings first.
#### c. Using the Steam Web API
Alternatively, you can search for the game appid using the Steam Web API:
```bash
$ steam-launch --alias -a {game_name} {alias}
```
Example:
```bash
$ steam-launch --alias -a "Red Dead Redemption 2" rdr2
```
If you want the alias to be the exact game name, omit the alias argument:
```bash
$ steam-launch --alias -a {game_name}
```
Example:
```bash
$ steam-launch --alias -a Portal
```
**Note 1:** An Internet connection is required for this feature.
**Note 2:** Game name must be exact match (case sensitive).
**Note 3:** This may not work as expected if multiple games share exactly the same name.
#### d. Editing the Alias File Directly
You can edit the alias file (`~/.config/steam-launch/alias.json`) directly. Add a new entry to the file where key is alias name and value is game id.
Example:
```json
{
    "rdr2": 1174180,
    "Portal": 400
}
```

### 4. Managing Aliases

- To update an alias, simply create a new alias with the same name, and it will overwrite the existing one.
- To remove an alias:
  ```bash
  $ steam-launch --rmalias {alias}
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  $ steam-launch --rmalias rdr2
  ```
- To list aliases:
  ```bash
  $ steam-launch --list
  ```
You can have multiple aliases for the same game.

### 5. Launching Games

To launch a game, simply use the alias as a single parameter:
```bash
$ steam-launch {alias}
```
Example:
```bash
$ steam-launch rdr2
```

### 6. Customizing Settings

#### a. Changing the Steam Command

If Steam is installed in a non-default way (e.g., via Flatpak or Snap), you may need to update the `steam` command used by `steam-launch`:
```bash
$ steam-launch --cfg --steam-command {steam_command}
```
Example:
```bash
$ steam-launch --cfg --steam-command "flatpak run com.valvesoftware.Steam"
```

#### b. Changing the `steamapps` Directory

For non-standard installations of Steam you may need to update the `steamapps` location before adding aliases by searching local files:
```bash
$ steam-launch --cfg --steamapps-path {steamapps_location}
```
Example (for Flatpak):
```bash
$ steam-launch --cfg --steamapps-path ~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.steam/steam/steamapps
```

#### c. Using `xdg-open`

In some cases for non-standard Steam installations running
```bash
$ {steam_command} steam://rungameid/{appid}
```
may work correctly only when Steam is not running.
To fix this `steam-launch` can use `xdg-open` instead when Steam is running. To enable this run:
```bash
$ steam-launch --cfg --xdg-open true
```
To disable run:
```bash
$ steam-launch --cfg --xdg-open true
```
**Note:** Make sure `xdg-open` correctly recognized `steam://` URLs.

#### d. Adding Steam Launch Arguments

If you typically launch Steam with additional arguments, you can configure `steam-launch` to use them (or you can add arguments specific to `steam-launch`):
```bash
$ steam-launch --cfg --steam-args "{your_args}"
```
Example:
```bash
$ steam-launch --cfg --steam-args "-forcedesktopscaling=1.5 -silent"
```
#### e. Changing how Steam is run

If when you launch a game with `steam-launch` Steam is not running, it will first start Steam and then launch the game. By default `steam-launch` will start Steam in the background, discarding its console output. If you want to see its output you can do:
```bash
$ steam-launch --cfg --background false
```
To return it back to the default state:
```bash
$ steam-launch --cfg --background true
```
